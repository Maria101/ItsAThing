        What it stands for and how it has changed peoples lives?
        </p>
       

 <p>This is an identity, not one's sexual orientation. That is something completely different. The goal of this website is to shed some light on what it is that most people do not abut this label. This is a label that some put on themselves because they feel it is right for them just like other identities as male or female, however, a genderfluid person is best described as people who go through the mix, depending on how they feel.</p>
      
 <p>  There are different stages of being genderfluid at not many may understand but we are what we are. That's right I said we, I am also genderfluid.</p>
